# OpenCHAMI Weekly Digest

## Highlights
- **Dual-stack networking improved**: Added DHCPv6 support and enhanced documentation, helping users deploy IPv4/IPv6 networks more easily ([coresmd #41](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/pull/41)).
- **New DNS header plugin**: Introduced a new header plugin to the DNS server, allowing more customization for DNS traffic handling ([coresmd #42](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/pull/42)).
- **Bug fix needed on Fabrica startup**: SQLite backend causes startup failures in Fabrica when using the "ent" backend, currently under investigation ([fabrica #28](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/fabrica/issues/28)).
- **Resolved DHCPv6 support issue**: coresmd’s past limitation on DHCPv6 was closed after feature improvements ([coresmd #40](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/issues/40)).
- **Fabrica versioning enhancement**: Introducing Kubebuilder-style versioning to better manage API lifecycle and compatibility ([fabrica #27](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/fabrica/pull/27)).
- **Updated community governance**: New architecture decision records (ADRs) formalize service renaming and merge policies to guide collaboration ([community #33](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/pull/33), [community #32](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/pull/32)).
- **API versioning documented**: Clear guidelines added for API versioning to standardize development ([community #27](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/pull/27)).
- **Website updates**: Blog posts and tutorials improved with new content related to the boot-service, aiding new user onboarding ([openchami.org #61](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/openchami.org/pull/61)).
