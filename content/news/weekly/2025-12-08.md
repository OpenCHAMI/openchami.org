## Highlights

- **Simpler API package generation** requested for the [fabrica](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/fabrica/issues/26) repo, aiming to streamline module and application integrations.
- **CoreDNS plugin enhancement**: The [coresmd](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/issues/30) repo added a “Fallthrough” feature to improve DNS routing flexibility.
- **Power-control security boosted** with OAuth2 token-based authentication for SMD requests, improving access control ([power-control #56](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/power-control/pull/56)).
- **Image-builder usability improved** by allowing users to add extra DNF arguments, giving more control over system image builds ([image-builder #51](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/image-builder/pull/51)).
- **Fixes for network interface parsing** enhance reliability of ethernet configuration in [boot-service](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/boot-service/pull/2).
- **New discovery format and conversion** added to [ochami](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/ochami/pull/63), expanding data interoperability.
- **Security middleware upgrade** underway in [tokensmith](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/tokensmith/pull/6) with Casbin integration for more robust policy enforcement.
- **Release cycle highlights:**  
  - [coresmd v0.4.1](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/releases/tag/v0.4.1) brings bug fixes and improvements.
  - [versitygw-quadlet v0.3.0](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/versitygw-quadlet/releases/tag/v0.3.0) marks a notable update.
- **Community building** progress: maintainers and code owners files proposed for better project governance in [community repo](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/issues/21).
- **Content and docs polish:** Several documentation improvements merged into [openchami.org](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/openchami.org/pulls), including a new blog post announcing OpenCHAMI on vTDS.
