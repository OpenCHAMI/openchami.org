## Highlights

- **Expanded Hardware Support:** Ongoing work to support air-cooled Grace-Grace ARM CPU nodes in [ex-bootstrap](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/ex-bootstrap/issues/3).
- **Enhanced DHCPv6 Support:** Added DHCPv6 support in [coresmd](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/pull/41), improving dual-stack network configurations for modern environments.
- **Improved Serial Console Access:** Introducing RF SerialConsole support in [magellan](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/magellan/issues/127) for better remote management.
- **API Package Generation:** New feature in [fabrica](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/fabrica/issues/26) to generate API packages for existing modules/applications, streamlining developer workflows.
- **Versioning Improvements:** Added Kubebuilder-style versioning in [fabrica](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/fabrica/pull/27) and new versioning features in [metadata-service](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/metadata-service/pull/1).
- **Simplified Policy Management:** Replaced the internal policy engine with [Casbin](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/tokensmith/pull/6) in [tokensmith](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/tokensmith/issues/5) for robust and flexible access control.
- **Hostname and Configuration Enhancements:** Introduced hostname patterns and key=value config format in [coresmd](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/pull/38) and [coresmd](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/pull/37) to improve clarity and customization.
- **Documentation and Process Improvements:** Added README and external collectors section to [fru-tracker](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/fru-tracker/pull/3), plus testing and CI upgrades for various repos.
- **Releases:**  
  - [coresmd v0.5.0](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/releases/tag/v0.5.0) with major updates including IPv6 support and config improvements.  
  - [coresmd v0.4.2](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/releases/tag/v0.4.2) patch release.  
  - [ex-bootstrap v1.0.3](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/ex-bootstrap/releases/tag/v1.0.3) with IP allocation enhancements.
