# OpenCHAMI Weekly Digest (Last 7 Days)

## Highlights

- **SELinux compatibility fix underway**: Resolving an issue where the `coresmd-coredns` container struggles to read the Corefile reliably under SELinux access controls ([issue #39](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/release/issues/39), [PR #40](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/release/pull/40)).
- **Enhancing CoreDNS plugin**: Implementation started for a new Fallthrough feature in the CoreSMD CoreDNS plugin to improve DNS resolution flexibility ([issue #30](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/coresmd/issues/30)).
- **Improved secret management**: Ongoing work to better handle secret storage within the kube-deploy project for safer deployments ([issue #3](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/kube-deploy/issues/3)).
- **Power-control upgrade to Docker builds**: Transition completed to Docker-based build and release workflow, simplifying and standardizing builds ([PR #57](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/power-control/pull/57), [PR #59](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/power-control/pull/59)).
- **OAuth2 tokens for secure requests**: Added support for OAuth2 access tokens to SMD requests to enhance authentication ([PR #56](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/power-control/pull/56)).
- **Better kernel boot scripts**: New PR adds JSON-configurable kernel parameter list support on `/bootscript`, improving boot customization ([PR #75](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/bss/pull/75)).
- **Policy management modernization**: The Tokensmith project is replacing its internal policy engine with the widely used Casbin library for authorization ([issue #5](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/tokensmith/issues/5), [PR #6](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/tokensmith/pull/6)).
- **Documentation and community standards**: New guides for coding standards and linters drafted to boost code quality and consistency ([issue #11](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/issues/11)); added maintainers and codeowners to multiple repos to improve project governance ([issue #21](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/issues/21)).
- **Website fixes and updates**: Resolved excessive whitespace on the tutorial page affecting Chrome users ([PR #54](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/openchami.org/pull/54)); updated conference listings and logos for 2026 events ([PR #51](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/openchami.org/pull/51)).
- **Deployment recipes dependencies updated**: Continued dependency bumps for improved security and stability across repositories ([PR #143](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/deployment-recipes/pull/143), [PR #127](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/deployment-recipes/pull/127)).
