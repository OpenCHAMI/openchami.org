# Who We Are

OpenCHAMI is an open-source, composable toolkit for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure management.
We’ve recently formed partnerships with both the **Linux Foundation** and the **High Performance Software Foundation (HPSF)**
to deepen our commitment to open-source collaboration in the HPC/AI community.

## OpenCHAMI’s Journey and Evolution

Founded in 2023 by a consortium of HPC centers and research institutions(LANL, NERSC, CSCS, HPE, and the University of Bristol), OpenCHAMI began as an innovative response
to the rigid, monolithic HPC management solutions of the past. Early efforts repurposed proven components from Cray
System Manager (CSM) to address the evolving needs of modern HPC environments. Over time, OpenCHAMI evolved into
a suite of modular microservices designed for automated hardware discovery, secure bootstrapping, and API-driven
infrastructure management.

This journey of decentralized innovation, built on trust and open collaboration, has united a global community of
practitioners—making OpenCHAMI a natural fit for HPC Infrastructure Management.

## Partnership with the Linux Foundation

**Empowering Decentralized Innovation in HPC/AI Infrastructure Management**
OpenCHAMI, the open-source, composable toolkit for HPC and AI infrastructure management,
is excited to announce its formal integration into the **Linux Foundation**—a neutral, trusted hub where developers and
organizations collaborate to code, manage, and scale transformative open technology projects.

This significant milestone reinforces OpenCHAMI’s dedication to developing open, scalable, and composable solutions for
provisioning and managing HPC and AI infrastructures across diverse environments.
Together, OpenCHAMI and the Linux Foundation will **drive the future of HPC/AI infrastructure management** by combining
community-driven innovation with the power of a neutral, globally recognized open-source home.

By joining the Linux Foundation, we gain a **neutral, trusted hub** where developers and organizations collaborate to
code, manage, and scale transformative open technology projects. At the same time, our HPSF partnership strengthens
our alignment with a global community of HPC professionals focused on fostering innovation in HPC and AI.

## Partnership with HPSF

As HPC and AI systems continue to expand in capability and complexity, their administration demands robust, flexible,
and community-driven tooling. By collaborating with **HPSF**, OpenCHAMI signals its alignment with the foundation’s
mission to *“fuel innovation in high performance computing through open-source collaboration.”* This partnership will
empower broader community engagement, shared best practices, and a united effort to support the long-term evolution of
HPC/AI infrastructure management.
