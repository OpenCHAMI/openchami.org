# OpenCHAMI Weekly Digest: Nov 03–Nov 10, 2025

## Highlights
- **Multi-architecture support advancing:** Image Builder continues to expand with a new open PR for multi-arch manifests ([#49](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/image-builder/pull/49)) and an enhancement issue focused on multi-arch image manifests ([#15](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/image-builder/issues/15)).
- **Improved SMD APIs:** Feature request for idempotent update APIs in SMD is open, alongside active work adding SerialConsole and CommandShell support to Redfish ([Feature #79](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/smd/issues/79), PR [#81](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/smd/pull/81)).
- **Power control updates:** Latest SMD images integrated via a merged PR, boosting stability and capabilities ([PR #55](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/power-control/pull/55)).
- **Deployment recipes bug identified:** A reported issue with `bss-init` failing in the quickstart guide related to docker compose and architecture requirements ([#142](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/deployment-recipes/issues/142)).
- **OpenCHAMI/ochami release v0.5.6:** New version delivered with bug fixes and improvements; also addressing BMC addition errors ([v0.5.6 release](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/ochami/releases/tag/v0.5.6), Issue [#55](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/ochami/issues/55)).
- **Boot Service API backward compatibility issue:** Legacy endpoint `/boot/v1/bootparameters` not fully compatible with BSS clients, pending resolution ([#1](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/boot-service/issues/1)).
- **Roadmap planning:** Proposals for Hardware Inventory API and SerialConsole Redfish support show focus on deeper hardware & system management integration ([#112](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap/issues/112), [#120](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap/issues/120)).
- **Community improvements:** Workflow updates enhance token verification and automation with a new weekly digest workflow merged ([#37](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/pull/37), [#36](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/pull/36)).
- **Documentation progress:** Ongoing efforts to enhance technical writing are visible with an open docs-focused PR ([#45](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/openchami.org/pull/45)).
