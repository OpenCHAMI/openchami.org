## *Designing for Reliability, Simplicity, and the Sysadmin*

---

## 📝 Introduction: Learning from Experience
Software isn’t just about writing code—it’s about making **deliberate choices** based on **real-world needs**. At OpenCHAMI, every design decision comes from **lessons learned in HPC system management**—some through **careful planning**, and others through **painful experience**.

The principles below aren’t just **abstract ideals**—they are **practical rules** that guide how we build OpenCHAMI. They reflect the trade-offs we’ve had to make and the priorities we’ve had to balance.

---

## 1️⃣ The Sysadmin is Responsible for Preventing Downtime. Serve the Sysadmin.
### *"If a system is down, it’s the sysadmin’s problem. Make it easier, not harder."*

HPC systems are mission-critical. When they go down, **someone gets a phone call**—and that person is usually the sysadmin.

That’s why OpenCHAMI is built with one core customer in mind: **the person who has to keep the system running.** Every design choice prioritizes **reducing unplanned maintenance activities** and ensuring **sysadmins have full visibility and control** over the system.

🚀 **What This Means for OpenCHAMI:**  
✔️ System failures should be predictable, not mysterious.  
✔️ Logs, metrics, and error messages should **help**, not confuse.  
✔️ If an upgrade or feature adds risk, **we rethink it**.  

---

## 2️⃣ Eliminate Complexity.
### *"The easiest way to manage complexity is to remove it."*

Complexity isn’t just **an inconvenience**—it’s **a risk**. Every added feature, configuration, or service introduces **new failure modes**.  

We believe that **the best system management tools are the ones you don’t notice** because they **just work**. OpenCHAMI avoids unnecessary dependencies and favors **simpler, more maintainable solutions**.

🚀 **What This Means for OpenCHAMI:**  
✔️ Avoid adding **configuration settings that won’t be used**.  
✔️ Don’t build unnecessary integrations—**let sites choose their own tools**.  
✔️ Prioritize **"sane defaults"** to reduce tuning complexity.  

---

## 3️⃣ Where Complexity is Useful to the Sysadmin, Make it Transparent.
### *"Sometimes complexity is unavoidable. But it should never be hidden."*

There are cases where complexity **serves a purpose**—for example:
- Fine-tuning network configurations  
- Customizing job scheduling policies  
- Managing hardware variations  

The key isn’t to **eliminate** this complexity, but to **make it transparent**—**always show what’s happening under the hood.**

🚀 **What This Means for OpenCHAMI:**  
✔️ Logs and debugging tools should **expose the real state of the system**.  
✔️ Automation should be **optional, not forced**.  
✔️ Documentation should **explain how things work**, not just how to use them.  

---

## 4️⃣ The Best Code for OpenCHAMI is Written and Maintained by a Larger Community.
### *"We focus on what makes OpenCHAMI unique and rely on larger projects for everything else."*

A **common mistake** in infrastructure projects is **reinventing solutions** that already exist elsewhere. OpenCHAMI **doesn’t need to create**:
- **An API Gateway** → There are mature, battle-tested options like **Kong, Envoy, and Traefik**.  
- **A Certificate Authority** → We rely on **well-established PKI and ACME-based tooling** instead of building our own.  
- **A Custom Database or Storage Layer** → OpenCHAMI **works with standard databases** rather than designing custom persistence models.

Instead of trying to **own every problem**, we **focus only on what’s specific to OpenCHAMI and HPC**:
- ✅ **Node lifecycle management**  
- ✅ **Cluster-wide configuration orchestration**  
- ✅ **HPC-specific security and authentication models**  

By **delegating non-HPC-specific problems** to **broader open-source communities**, OpenCHAMI remains **lightweight, maintainable, and future-proof**.

🚀 **What This Means for OpenCHAMI:**  
✔️ **Reuse mature external projects** instead of reinventing infrastructure.  
✔️ **Stay modular**—integrate easily with industry-standard tools.  
✔️ **Contribute upstream** to projects we rely on instead of forking or duplicating efforts.

## 5️⃣ The Best Way to Fix Distributed Systems is Not to Have Them.
### *"Distributed systems fail in ways you can’t predict. Avoid them when possible."*

Clusters are inherently distributed, but that doesn’t mean **every piece of software managing them** has to be. OpenCHAMI **avoids** unnecessary distributed components because:
- **Synchronization failures** are hard to debug.  
- **Network dependencies** introduce new failure points.  
- **Single-node services are easier to scale than complex distributed ones.**  

🚀 **What This Means for OpenCHAMI:**  
✔️ Prefer **stateless, independent services** over **distributed coordination**.  
✔️ **Reduce reliance on external databases** when possible.  
✔️ If something must be distributed, **keep it simple**.  

---

## 6️⃣ Support HTTP REST APIs (And Why We Chose HTTP Over GRPC).
### *"We prioritize protocols that sysadmins can easily use and debug."*

At one point, we **considered supporting gRPC and other binary protocols**. However, we **stuck with HTTP** because:

- **Sysadmins can use `curl`, `wget`, or Postman** to troubleshoot API requests.  
- **Logging and monitoring tools for HTTP are widely available and well-understood.**  
- **Network firewalls, proxies, and load balancers all support HTTP by default.**  
- **Almost every programming language has robust HTTP libraries**—without requiring a special SDK.

🚀 **What This Means for OpenCHAMI:**  
✔️ **Stick with widely supported, human-friendly protocols**.  
✔️ **Prioritize ease of debugging over theoretical efficiency**.  
✔️ **Keep APIs scriptable and accessible to sysadmins first.**

## 📌 Final Thoughts
OpenCHAMI’s engineering principles **aren’t just guidelines**—they are **the foundation of every design decision we make**. They help us **prioritize the right trade-offs**, ensure **reliability**, and most importantly, **serve the sysadmins** who keep HPC systems running.
