Most of the components found in a deployment of OpenCHAMI are not part of the OpenCHAMI project.  Common open source-software like `dnsmasq` and `haproxy` have much larger developer and user communities, and they fulfill HPC needs without customization.  There are also plenty of resources for teams that would prefer alternatives to each of the recommended third party applications. 

Where OpenCHAMI microservices do need to be specific, we favor, but do not require, a set of common technologies.
