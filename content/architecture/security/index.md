## üìå Overview
OpenCHAMI enforces a **modern authentication model** designed to replace traditional **SSH keys and password-based authentication** with a **secure, scalable, and identity-driven access system**. This page explains how OpenCHAMI implements **OIDC-based authentication**, **role-based access control (RBAC)**, and **machine identity verification** to ensure secure access.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication in OpenCHAMI

### **OpenID Connect (OIDC) & JWT-Based Authentication**
Sites generally have their own way of managing sysadmin and user identity.  OpenCHAMI leverages existing authentication through **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for identity management, allowing seamless integration with existing authentication providers such as:
- üîê **LDAP** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)  
- üîê **Keycloak** (Self-hosted identity provider)  
- üîê **Okta, GitHub, or institutional SSO providers**  

When a user or service authenticates with OpenCHAMI:
1. They are redirected to an **OIDC provider** for authentication.  
2. Once authenticated, the provider issues a **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.  
3. OpenCHAMI **validates the JWT** and extracts identity and role information.  
4. The user/service gains **access only to authorized resources** based on their role.  

### **üîß Why OpenCHAMI Uses OIDC & JWT**
‚úÖ **Stateless Authentication** ‚Äì No need to store session data; tokens are self-contained.  
‚úÖ **Interoperability** ‚Äì Works with many enterprise identity providers.  
‚úÖ **Fine-Grained Access Control** ‚Äì JWT claims can define user roles and permissions.  
‚úÖ **Short-Lived Credentials** ‚Äì Prevents long-lived access tokens from being exploited.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC ensures that **users, services, and nodes** only have the **minimum necessary privileges** in OpenCHAMI.

### **üîπ Default Roles in OpenCHAMI**
| Role        | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **Admin**   | Full control over OpenCHAMI services, configurations, and security policies. |
| **Operator** | Can manage clusters, nodes, and jobs but cannot modify security settings. |
| **Scheduler** | Headless accounts with permissions necessary for Job Management |
| **User**    | Can submit and monitor jobs but cannot modify system settings. |
| **Service** | Headless accounts for system components interacting with OpenCHAMI APIs. |

Administrators can **customize roles and permissions** using OIDC group mappings.

### **üîê How RBAC Works**
1. A user logs in via **OIDC authentication**.  
2. The JWT **includes role claims** (e.g., `"role": "operator"`).  
3. OpenCHAMI **validates** the role and grants **only the necessary access**.  
4. Actions are **restricted** based on the user's role.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine-Based Authentication

Traditional HPC systems **authenticate users, not machines**‚Äîleaving system provisioning vulnerable to **stolen credentials and misconfigurations**.  

OpenCHAMI **flips this model**, requiring **nodes to authenticate themselves before bootstrapping**. This is achieved through:
- **WireGuard-based node identity verification** (covered in the next section).  
- **Future TPM-based machine attestation** to cryptographically verify hardware integrity.  

### **üîπ Why Machine-Based Authentication?**
‚úÖ **No embedded SSH keys** ‚Üí Eliminates pre-installed secrets in system images.  
‚úÖ **Node-specific identity** ‚Üí Each node has a unique authentication key.  
‚úÖ **Stronger security guarantees** ‚Üí Prevents unauthorized machines from joining clusters.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Token Management in OpenCHAMI

OpenCHAMI **does not rely on persistent authentication**. Instead, it enforces:
- **Short-lived JWTs** for all users and services.  
- **Refresh tokens** that expire after a predefined period.  
- **Automated token revocation** upon session logout or security policy changes.  

Admins can integrate **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for an additional layer of security.
