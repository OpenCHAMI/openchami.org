### Summary

In this talk, Alex discussed the formation of the OpenCHAMI consortium focused on creating cloud-like experiences for on-premises HPC (High-Performance Computing) systems through open-source tools. He highlights the challenges faced by the HPC community, including the influence of larger AI and cloud markets and the brain drain from HPC innovation. The consortium, hosted at openchami.org, emphasizes a modular and accessible approach, allowing users to tailor their HPC environments to their specific needs. Alex underscores the importance of public, community-driven development and transparent governance in sustaining the future of HPC system management. He calls for broader involvement from vendors, sites, and individuals to shape the next generation of HPC tools.
