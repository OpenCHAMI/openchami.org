Managing large-scale infrastructure requires **automated hardware discovery** and **inventory tracking**. OpenCHAMI’s **Magellan** is a tool designed to streamline **Board Management Controller (BMC) discovery** using the **Redfish API**. Whether you’re managing a single rack or an entire data center, Magellan helps **automate system discovery, collect inventory data, and integrate seamlessly with OpenCHAMI’s System Management Database (SMD).**

## **🔹 Key Features of Magellan**

✔️ **Network Scanning** – Discover **active BMC nodes** in a subnet automatically.
✔️ **Inventory Collection** – Retrieve **detailed system information** from each discovered node via Redfish.
✔️ **Firmware Management** – Identify and update firmware versions on discovered nodes.
✔️ **SMD Integration** – Load **hardware inventory data directly into OpenCHAMI’s System Management Database (SMD).**
✔️ **JSON Export** – Store inventory data in structured **JSON format** for easy parsing and external integration.
