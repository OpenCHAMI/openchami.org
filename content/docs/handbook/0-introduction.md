Welcome to OpenCHAMI!

This handbook is meant to serve as a guide and a reference for deploying,
configuring, and administering OpenCHAMI.

## 0.1. How to Use The Documentation

The documentation section has been split into subsections based on purpose:

- [**OpenCHAMI Tutorial**](/docs/tutorial) -- A detailed guide for deploying
  virtual machines using OpenCHAMI meant to be a practical way for
  understanding OpenCHAMI.
- [**The OpenCHAMI Handbook**](/docs/handbook) (_You are here_) -- The main
  guide for configuring the core of OpenCHAMI for most use cases, with links to
  other relevant content.
- [**Guides**](/docs/guides) -- Guides documenting how to deploy/use OpenCHAMI
  for some extended use cases.
- [**Architecture**](/docs/architecture) -- Details on component organization,
  philosophy, design decisions, etc.
- [**Software**](/docs/software) -- Details on each software component in
  OpenCHAMI, including detailed configuration documentation.

This handbook is organized by chapter and attempt to logically organize
information
