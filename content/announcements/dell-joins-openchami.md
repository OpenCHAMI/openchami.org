The OpenCHAMI community is delighted to announce that **Dell Technologies** has formally joined the OpenCHAMI consortium as a full voting member. Dell now holds seats on both the **Governing Board** and the **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**, alongside founding members such as LANL, HPE, CSCS, and NERSC.

NERSC nominated Dell based on their consistent commitment to open, community‑driven innovation in high-performance computing (HPC). Dell’s selection to supply NERSC’s next flagship [supercomputer](https://www.nersc.gov/news-and-events/news/doe-announces-new-supercomputer-powered-by-dell-and-nvidia-to-speed-scientific-discovery) reinforces their leadership.

> “Dell’s open‑source mindset and deep systems expertise will strengthen OpenCHAMI’s mission of building transparent, modular tooling for HPC operators.”
> — Eric Roman, Computational Systems Group, NERSC
