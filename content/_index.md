## Open Composable Heterogeneous Adaptable Management Infrastructure

**OpenCHAMI** (Open Composable Heterogeneous Adaptable Management Infrastructure) is an open-source system management platform designed to bring **cloud-like flexibility and security** to High Performance Computing (HPC) environments. It provides modern tools to efficiently **deploy, manage, and scale** HPC clusters, making it easier for organizations to support both traditional scientific workloads and emerging **AI, ML, and data-driven applications**.

### **Key Features**

- 🛡 **Security-First Architecture** – Implements **zero-trust authentication**, fine-grained **access control**, and **OIDC-based authorization** to safeguard HPC environments.
- 🧩 **Composable & Scalable** – Modular, cloud-native design supports **heterogeneous compute infrastructures** across on-prem and cloud environments.
- 🔧 **Microservices-Based** – Built on **lightweight, containerized services**, making deployment and scaling more efficient.
- 🌐 **Community-Driven & Open** – Developed **in collaboration with leading HPC sites** under the **Linux Foundation HPC initiative**, ensuring transparency and innovation.
- 🚀 **Fast Boot** - Faster and more secure boot times with cloud-init.  POST + 40 seconds!


### **Why OpenCHAMI?**

HPC system management has traditionally relied on **monolithic, complex, and rigid** solutions that are difficult to adapt to modern workloads. OpenCHAMI **bridges the gap between HPC and cloud-native technologies** by providing:

- **Security & Compliance** – Designed with modern security best practices for protecting critical infrastructure.
- **Cloud-Like Flexibility** – Enables dynamic, on-demand scaling and **automation** of system resources.
- **Open & Transparent Governance** – Unlike proprietary solutions, OpenCHAMI is **community-led** and continuously evolving.
