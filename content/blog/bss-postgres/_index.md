## Introduction

As part of LANL's project to discover and boot a small cluster using components
from _Cray System Manager_ (CSM), we needed to deeply understand the existing
_Boot Script Service_ (BSS). We used BSS as an example service to make a
substantive change to the software as shipped by HPE. We replaced the existing
Etcd database with a PostgreSQL instance that was easier for us to manage.

We should point out that the Etcd implementation itself wasn't problematic.
We've seen it successfully used to boot hundreds of nodes without issue. Our
goal was to assess the level of effort needed to identify internal boundaries in
the CSM service and make changes without altering the fundamental behavior of
the service.

## How Does an HPC System Boot?

Before we delve too deeply into the function of the BSS microservice, we should
clarify a few things. For HPC systems like the Cray EX systems delivered by HPE,
boot management is slightly different than you might be familiar with in your
datacenter. First of all, the compute nodes are generally "stateless". From one
reboot to another, nothing is preserved. In fact, many HPC systems use compute
nodes that lack internal disks. They boot from a network image and run entirely
from RAM. BSS is a microservice for managing how the network filesystem is
configured and delivered to a set of compute nodes. HPC administrators use API
calls to BSS to pick the kernel and network boot images along with boot
parameters. On a system with thousands of nodes that may each contain different
hardware and network configurations, the combination of settings needed can be
fairly cumbersome.

## BSS in CSM

As a component of CSM, BSS stores the boot configuration of nodes. This
information includes the URI of the kernel to boot, as well as an optional URI
of an initrd (if the kernel expects one) and an optional string of kernel boot
parameters. When a stateless node requests its DHCP configuration, the DHCP
server directs the node to obtain a boot script from the BSS "bootscript"
endpoint. That endpoint can differentiate between hosts based on hostname or MAC
and generate an iPXE boot script that integrates the kernel/initrd URIs and any
boot parameters. The iPXE bootloader, running on the compute node, can then HTTP
GET the kernel and initrd specified in the script and boot them with any
configured kernel parameters.

The way that BSS originally stored this data was via key-value storage. Etcd has
a robust storage mechanism: it uses a quorum of nodes to decide what data
changes and when this data should change, and it provides data redundancy in
case a node (or its storage media) go down. This is great on an exascale system,
but rather inconvenient on a smaller system, for example, a ten-node cluster. On
a scale as small as this, we would rather have a lightweight storage backend
like a PostgreSQL database. For this reason as well as others, the ability to
use a PostgreSQL backend was added to BSS for smaller deployments.

## The BSS Database Architecture

### Formulation

Concepts in key-value storage do not translate well into concepts in relational
databases. Instead of simply defining a key and storing a piece of data at that
key, some foresight into the relationships between objects had to be
established. It took four rounds to get a schema that made sense and could be
implemented adequately. This is the schema that we came up with:

At the core, nodes (specified by boot MAC address, hostname, or node ID) are
assigned a boot configuration, which consists of a kernel URI, an optional
initrd URI, and optional kernel parameters. 

#### A Note on Grouping Nodes

BSS also supports named node groups. Rather than storing identical data for
multiple nodes, a single name can be assigned to a boot configuration. Any nodes
that are a member of the named group will share that boot configuration. Through
interplay between the inventory system and BSS, grouping is stored as a feature
of the inventory and used within BSS. In the interest of a speedy experiment, we
decided to forgo the integration challenge of making changes to two services so
grouping support is not part of our current fork. This highlights the one issue
of working with CSM code: the APIs are not as cleanly separated by domain as we
would like and exploring the grouping feature further will require some kind of
architectural change.

### Defining Object Relationships

The `nodes` and `boot_configs` tables were the obvious structures that were
needed first for the aforementioned node-boot-config relationship. The question
was then how to relate the two.

Since nodes could be members of a boot group, the `boot_groups` table made sense
to have as well. Plus, if multiple un-grouped nodes had the same boot
configuration, a single boot group (and corresponding boot configuration) whose
name was not specifically defined could be created for these nodes to share.
That way, many duplicate boot configurations need not be created in the
database. Therefore, boot groups serve the purpose of grouping nodes by boot
configuration, whether or not they are a member of a named group. Now, how
should nodes be assigned to boot configurations (or, more technically, a boot
group)?

Rather than have each node itself keep track of which boot group it is a part
of, a separate table that maps nodes to boot groups, the
`boot_group_assignments` table, was created to make joins easier and less
costly. This table maps node UUIDs to boot group UUIDs, so querying the nodes in
a boot group or querying the boot groups (and therefore boot configurations) for
one or more nodes is just a matter of joining the tables.

## Interaction with SMD

When BSS receives a request to produce an iPXE boot script for a node, it first
checks the _State Management Database_ (SMD) for the node's existence, since the
node has to have been discovered by Magellan and be populated in SMD in order
for it to have a boot configuration. It turns out that it was not possible to
manually add nodes to SMD without using discovery for testing BSS, and so SMD
was modified to be able to do so.

Once the node has been verified to exist, an iPXE boot script is generated using
the node's boot MAC address and kernel URI, as well as the initrd URI and kernel
parameters if they were specified. If the node does not exist, a generic,
failover iPXE boot script is generated.

## An Example iPXE Boot Script

If, for example, a node is added like so (assuming this node exists in SMD with
xname `x0c0s1b0`):

```json
{
    "macs": ["02:0b:b8:00:30:00"],
    "kernel": "https://example.org/kernel",
    "initrd": "https://example.org/initrd",
    "params": "console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8"
}
```

then a boot script generated could look like (ignoring cloud-init):

```ipxe
#!ipxe
kernel --name kernel https://example.org/kernel initrd=initrd console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 xname=x0c0s1b0 ds=nocloud-net;s=localhost/ || goto boot_retry                                               
initrd --name initrd https://example.org/initrd || goto boot_retry
boot || goto boot_retry
:boot_retry
sleep 30
chain https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootscript?mac=02:0b:b8:00:30:00&retry=1
```

The boot script will try to boot the kernel specified at the kernel URI, passing
in the kernel parameters, and will try to use the initrd at the initrd URI, if
passed. If any of these fail, it will fail over to the failover DHCP server and
get that boot script.

If the node does not exist in SMD, the boot script generated will look something
like the below, going straight to the failover boot script:

```ipxe
#!ipxe
sleep 10
chain https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootscript?mac=02:0b:b8:00:30:00&arch=${buildarch}&ts=1696373833 
```

## Concluding Thoughts

While Etcd is a strong and robust storage backend, there are use cases where a
smaller, less complex storage mechanism would suit better. With open source
software like Ochami that is meant to be able to run on heterogeneous
architectures and hardware, this addition to BSS will allow it to meet these
diversity requirements. In the future, we would like to consider ways of making
BSS function even better as a standalone boot script service with more
composable storage options.
