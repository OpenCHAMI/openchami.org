The University of Bristol hosted the OpenCHAMI Community for a developer summit in September of 20204.  There were representatives from a dozen organizations represented.  We discussed current needs ot the project as well as possible future uses and directions.  Industry representatives shared how they would like to use OpenCHAMI and how they might get more deeply involved.
