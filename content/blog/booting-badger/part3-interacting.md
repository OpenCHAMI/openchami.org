## Interacting with OpenCHAMI

OpenCHAMI operates more like a cloud API than a traditional HPC management tool. This means that commands don’t rely on POSIX user/group details for success. Instead, all interactions with the system are API-driven, whether you’re on the head node, a different node, or managing remotely from the cloud.

### Authentication with JWTs

Authentication and authorization in OpenCHAMI are handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Once a JWT is issued, it can be reused until it expires, significantly reducing the need for constant authentication with a central server.  Our client has built-in tooling for requesting and managing a jwt for use with the microservices.

### Building a Client for Badger

During our deployment on Badger, we recognized the need for a dedicated client to interact with the OpenCHAMI API efficiently. Initially, we relied on `curl` commands wrapped in bash scripts, but this wasn’t sustainable and fairly frustrating for sysadmins.

We developed a CLI tool that wraps API interactions, making it easier for sysadmins to manage nodes, deploy images, and monitor the system. You can find it on Github at [Github.com/OpenCHAMI/ochami-cmdline](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/ochami-cmdline)

## Populating our Inventory System

As noted in the description of Badger, we weren't working with state-of-the-art hardware.  It lacked modern BMCs with Redfish support so our normal discovery tooling was useless.  Instead, we had to rely on manually curated lists of nodes.  All 660 Nodes needed to be enumerated in a flat file with no mistakes in order to enroll everything in the OpenCHAMI system.  The format of our `nodes.yaml` file will be familiar to many HPC sysadmins.  Without discovery, this process of manual enrollment should be familiar to many.  It includes the three main IP addresses necessary for communicating with the nodes, BMC for power control, High Speed for managing jobs, and a management ip for ssh access to nodes.  It also includes a MAC address, hostname, xname (indicating location in the racks), and node id (nid).  The last field is `group` which is how our system determines what the purpose of the node is.  For our purposes, every node is a `compute` node which contributes directly to running jobs.  In other systems, we also have `io` nodes that provide access to data and `visualization` nodes that researchers can use to see their results.  The list can be extended for all of the many supporting node types that exist in an HPC cluster.


```yaml
nodes:
-   bmc_ipaddr: 192.168.8.1
    hsn_ipaddr: 10.16.24.1
    ipaddr: 192.168.4.1
    group: compute
    mac: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
    name: ba001
    nid: 1
    xname: x1000c0s0b0n0
```

Some of the data in our configuration file isn't directly used by OpenCHAMI for building the inventory.  Instead, it is stored with the inventory and passed through to our cloud-init server which provides individualized information to each node at boot time. Services on the node can then use that information to configure services or set up jobs.


### Populate the Inventory
```bash
# Populate the inventory service (SMD) with nodes
ochami-cli smd --fake-discovery --payload nodes.yaml
```

### Review the created resources
```bash
# Review created resources within SMD
ochami-cli smd --get-components
ochami-cli smd --get-interfaces
```

> __NB__ SMD doesn't store nodes as "nodes".  It stores components which represent nodes as well as other things and it stores Interfaces which are related to components.  The full data model of SMD is beyond the scope of this discussion.  For our purposes, it is sufficient to know that the only components we care about in Badger are nodes so the two terms can be used interchangably.

### Add Boot Parameters

In OpenCHAMI, a boot configuration is stored separately from the definition of a node.  This allows us to create a single boot configuration and link it to many nodes and ensure that they boot the same image and kernel.  Until we have a more advanced CLI that allows us to work with collections of nodes easily, we added some `bss` commands to `ochami-cli` that deal manually with the boot script service (bss).  Once again, we have a yaml file that must be managed manually and then uploaded to bss in order to ensure each node boots correctly.

```yaml
macs:
  - AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
initrd: 'http://192.168.1.253:8080/alma/initramfs.img'
kernel: 'http://192.168.1.253:8080/alma/vmlinuz'
params: 'nomodeset ro ip=dhcp selinux=0 console=ttyS0,115200 ip6=off ochami_ci_url=http://10.1.0.3:8081/cloud-init/ ochami_ci_url_secure=http://10.1.0.3:8081/cloud-init-secure/ network-config=disabled rd.shell root=live:http://192.168.1.253:8080/alma/rootfs'
```

#### Kernel Commandline

In OpenCHAMI, our kernel commandline holds a lot of information about how the system supports the boot.

* __ochami_ci_url__ - The url for our cloud-init server which delivers a set of instance-specific information to each node
* __ochami_ci_url_secure__ - The secure endpoint for cloud-init which may transmit secrets
* __root__ - the root filesystem to boot.  This may be nfs:// or http:// or other exotic protocols as needed.  The `live` specification indicates that Linux will download the filesystem and make it an overlayfs layer for the newroot.

To populate BSS with `ochami-cli`:
```bash
ochami-cli bss --add-bootparams --payload bss.yaml
```
And to view the new data:
```bash
ochami-cli bss --get-bootparams
```

In the next post, we’ll explore how OpenCHAMI manages images and deployment workflows at scale, bringing everything together to help sysadmins efficiently manage large HPC environments.

Stay tuned for Part 4!
